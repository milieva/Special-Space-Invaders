Special-Space-Invaders
======================

Final project for Python course at Sofia University


When completed, this will be a modified version of the classic Space invaders game. The idea is that like in the classic one, the monsters appear, they move around and you have to shoot them. But they won't speed up. Instead of that, there will be a timer. If you don't manage to kill every monster until it reaches 0, the monsters merge in one super monster, which is harder to kill (its health will be the sum of all the monsters on the screen). There will be five levels (this might change) and in the last level you will fight with 3 super monsters one after the other. You will start with three lives. There will be no save option and no multiplayer option. After completion of each level you will unlock a set of skins for your ship and the monsters, from which you will be able to choose in the start menu. The start menu will be rather simple, you will have the option to start a new game, to view your achievements (there will be achievements) and choose your skin. Different bonuses will spawn during the game - bonus lives, a temporary different weapon, or a quicker ship.

For the second milestone I believe I will have created the classes needed - creature, monster, supermonster, hero, and some of the logic for their actions. For example, I hope to have described how the monsters move and to have the hero move and probably shoot. If I have described how the hero shoots and manage to think of a good collision detection I will describe how the monsters die as well. I hope to have some parts of the GUI running. I will probably use either Pygame or Kivy for this.
